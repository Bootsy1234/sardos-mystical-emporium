            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Sardo - that's "Sar-DOH!", emphasis on the "DOH!" - is the proud owner and operator of Sardo's Mystical Emporium, the finest (and only) shop of its kind. With decades of experience in the mystical arts, Sardo offers a wide range of magical artifacts, potions, and curiosities. Although he claims to be a "practitioner of the mystical arts," Sardo is often portrayed as more of a charlatan, with his magical items sometimes causing more harm than good. His store is a frequent setting for the strange and mysterious events that unfold in the world of "Are You Afraid of the Dark?"</p>

            <h2>Portfolio</h2>
            <p>Throughout the years, Sardo has encountered countless mystical objects, from cursed rings to enchanted mirrors. Here are just a few of the many magical items that have passed through his hands:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Silver Sight:</strong> A powerful but dangerous artifact, this ancient talisman allowed its users to see the future. But beware—the visions it grants are often cryptic and can lead to unintended consequences.</li>
                <li><strong>Crimson Claw:</strong> A cursed item that grants terrible wishes. This claw's power is only matched by its malevolence, twisting desires into nightmares. It's not for the faint of heart or those without careful consideration of their wishes.</li>
                <li><strong>The Potion of Eternal Youth:</strong> A concoction rumored to restore one's youth. However, the potion's effects are unpredictable, and its users have been known to pay a steep price for vanity.</li>
                <li><strong>The Laughing in the Dark Clown Doll:</strong> Not for the faint of heart, this doll carries the spirit of Zeebo the Clown. It's said that anyone who disrespects the doll will face terrifying consequences. Handle with care—or better yet, don't handle it at all.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Sardo's potion-making skills are unmatched (according to him). Whether you need a love potion to win over that special someone, an invisibility potion to make a quick getaway, or something a bit more esoteric, Sardo has the perfect brew for you. Just remember, the effects can be... unpredictable.</p>
            <h2>Featured Potions:</h2>
            <p><strong>Love Potion:</strong> A sweet-smelling concoction that will make anyone fall for you—at least for a little while. Beware of the potion's side effects, which may include obsession and unwanted attention. Price: $49.99</p>
            <p><strong>Invisibility Potion:</strong> Perfect for those times when you just need to disappear. However, the potion's effects wear off unpredictably, so use with caution. Price: $89.99</p>
            <p><strong>Potion of Eternal Youth:</strong> A highly sought-after elixir. Drinking it may roll back the years, but at what cost? Sardo doesn't guarantee the potion's effects will last. Price: $199.99</p>
